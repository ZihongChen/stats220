# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Data Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to improve my understanding of statistical methods, especially how to analyze data and make useful conclusions.
- I am interested in learning about how stats220 can help with my everyday life
